# ESP32-Projects

This repository contains various ESP32 projects covering basic to advanced functionalities, including LED control, 7-segment displays, OTA updates, Wi-Fi management, and web server integration.

## üìÇ Project Structure

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ 3_LED_Sequance
- Lights up three LEDs (Red, Green, Yellow) in sequence.
- A basic program to get started with ESP32.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ 4_7_segment_display
- Controls four 7-segment displays placed side by side.
- Useful for multi-digit numerical displays.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ 7-seg-display-0-9
- Controls a single 7-segment display.
- Displays digits from 0 to 9.
- A foundational project before working with multiple displays.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Arduino_OTA
- Enables Over-The-Air (OTA) programming for ESP32.
- Contains two subprojects:
  - **simple_led**: Basic OTA server setup.
  - **ESP_digital_clock**: Digital clock implementation with OTA.
- Note: The ESP32 must be connected to an external power supply for OTA updates.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ change_wifi_through_html
- Connects ESP32 to an initial Wi-Fi network.
- Generates an IP address that leads to an HTML page.
- Allows switching to another Wi-Fi network from the list of available networks.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ led_web_server
- Controls three LEDs (Red, Green, Yellow) via an HTML-based web interface.
- A screenshot of the web interface is included in the repository.
